# Changelog

## Unreleased

## [0.5.0-alpha.4] - 2026-08-26

### Changed

- Reworked the phone PDF editor into a compact ScorePDF-inspired two-row toolbar with one mode switch, color-tinted presets, fixed undo/redo/Done actions, and horizontal access to secondary tools.
- Simplified color and text editing so quick choices are visible first while HSV, line height, and alignment remain available under optional advanced controls.

### Fixed

- Corrected the scanner branding to SeliaScan across the app, website, and release documentation.

## [0.5.0-alpha.3] - 2026-08-26

### Added

- Contextual Draw and Objects tool groups with reusable pen presets, lasso selection, musical symbols, text editing, duplicate/delete actions, and one compact color control.
- Quick, recent, and custom HSV colors with opacity, live preview, and an eyedropper that samples the rendered PDF.
- Persisted annotation-tool order and visibility, drag-handle customization, palm rejection, and accessible move actions.
- Direct SeliaScan launch plus Android PDF share/open intake for validated content URI documents.
- Version 3 annotation storage for per-object opacity, text alignment and line height, and musical symbols rendered consistently in the reader and exported PDF.

### Changed

- Renamed the user-facing product to SeliaLists while preserving repository URLs and backup compatibility.
- Changed the Google Play application ID to `com.majkeylab.sheetset`; the new package installs separately, so migrate an existing library with ZIP backup and restore.
- Replaced the crowded annotation palette with a responsive two-row toolbar that keeps navigation and Done fixed while tools scroll.
- Grouped settings into Library, Reading, Data, and App pages with current-value rows and bounded choice dialogs.
- Replaced the SeliaLists launcher and Play Store artwork with the current first-party SeliaScan icon.
- Added Single, Half, and Two-page defaults to the main Reader settings page.
- Lowered the minimum version to Android 10 and moved per-app language handling to the AndroidX compatibility path.

### Fixed

- Preserved pinch focus, pan position, stylus ownership, and palm rejection across mixed-pointer editor gestures.
- Serialized per-score annotation saves so stale or failed writes cannot overwrite newer pages or enter a backup.
- Made native and shared backups wait for the latest successful annotation save and round-trip editor settings and version 3 annotations.
- Kept Back inside the reader, settings page, or drawer before reaching the app root.

### Removed

- Removed automatic scrolling and its speed setting to keep reader controls focused on manual and pedal page turns.

## [0.4.0-alpha.1] - 2026-08-24

### Added

- ScorePDF backup import that preserves every score record, PDF, setlist order, and duplicate occurrence without deleting the current library.
- Direct backup sharing through Android's share sheet and an optional Buy Me a Coffee link in About.
- Per-score bookmarks, bookmark search and direct jumps, saved reading position, and last-viewed sorting.
- Single, Half, and tablet Two-page reader layouts with layout-aware touch and pedal navigation.
- Page turning with common Bluetooth pedal and keyboard keys plus automatic fit-width scrolling at three speeds.
- Score and setlist labels, label search, and title/date sorting.

### Changed

- Catalog and native backup formats now write version 2 while retaining validated version 1 migration.
- The reader keeps one navigation row and puts layouts, automatic scrolling, and bookmarks in one performance-tools sheet.

### Fixed

- Android Back closes the active reader, detail, settings page, or drawer before reaching the root screen; root Back no longer exits SeliaLists.
- Automatic scrolling waits for the new PDF page to finish rendering before continuing.

## [0.3.0-alpha.2] - 2026-08-23

### Added

- Drag handles for direct setlist reordering, including edge scrolling and screen-reader move actions.

### Changed

- Replaced the crowded annotation strip and tablet side rail with a two-row bottom dock inspired by musician-first score readers.
- Split annotation tools into focused Draw and Add groups while keeping page navigation, undo, redo, and Done fixed.

### Fixed

- Freehand stroke commits keep an immutable snapshot of their points.
